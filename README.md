# Java Note-Taking Application

A simple console-based note-taking app developed in Java.  
This project allows users to add, display, edit, and delete notes saved in a text file. It’s designed to practice Java basics like file handling, user input with Scanner, and ArrayLists.

## Features

- Add new notes  
- View all saved notes  
- Edit existing notes  
- Delete notes  
- Data persistence through a text file (`not.txt`)

## How to Use

1. Run the program.  
2. Use the menu options to add, display, edit, or delete notes.  
3. Notes are saved automatically to the `not.txt` file.

## Technologies Used

- Java  
- File I/O (`File`, `FileWriter`, `Scanner`)  
- Collections (`ArrayList`)  

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed with the helpful assistance of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s AI language model.
